# Chagas_article_mimic
A python script of graphs mimicked from a research article regarding Chagas disease

This python script reproduces graphs from a published paper. The original paper explored possible Chagas disease biomarkers. This script recreates the
first two figures of the paper produced by Inmaculada et. al. The first figure produces two Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plots and a 3-dimensional PCA plot. The second 
figure generates a volcano plot with various thresholds.
